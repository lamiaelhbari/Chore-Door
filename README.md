# *Chore Door*

***Chore Door** : is an `interactive single-page` game created with JavaScript.*

*In this project, we’ll manipulate `DOM (Document Object Model)` elements to `access` and `modify HTML` elements, such as the door images and the start button, using `methods` like `getElementById`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, etc.* 

*We’ll also manage `user interactions`, control the` display of elements`, and apply game logic to create an engaging interactive experience.*
